Job Blue - Minimal PHP Frontend

How to run locally (no backend yet):
- Use any PHP-capable server, or run: `php -S localhost:8000 -t JobBlue`
- Open `http://localhost:8000/` in your browser.

Whatâ€™s included:
- `index.php` with responsive Login and Sign Up UI
- `assets/css/style.css` for palette, layout, and responsiveness
- `assets/js/script.js` for toggling forms and basic validation hints
- `includes/` shared header, footer, navbar

Notes:
- No database/auth integration yet. Forms are ready to wire up later.
